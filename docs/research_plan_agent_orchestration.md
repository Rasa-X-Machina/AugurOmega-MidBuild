# Agent Orchestration System Enhancement - Research Plan

## Task Overview
Build an enhanced agent orchestration system with:
- Real-time process management and monitoring
- Dynamic agent teams with adaptive specialization (upgrade from template-based)
- Executable Auditor enhancements
- Real-time agent lifecycle management
- Monitoring dashboard

## Current Analysis Phase
- [ ] 1.1 Examine existing persistent_agent_manager.py
- [ ] 1.2 Review augur_orchestrate.py implementation
- [ ] 1.3 Analyze incremental_enhancements.md requirements
- [ ] 1.4 Document current architecture and limitations

## System Design Phase
- [ ] 2.1 Design enhanced orchestration architecture
- [ ] 2.2 Define dynamic agent team structure
- [ ] 2.3 Plan adaptive specialization mechanisms
- [ ] 2.4 Design real-time monitoring capabilities
- [ ] 2.5 Design monitoring dashboard architecture

## Implementation Phase
- [ ] 3.1 Implement enhanced agent manager
- [ ] 3.2 Create dynamic team orchestrator
- [ ] 3.3 Build adaptive specialization system
- [ ] 3.4 Implement real-time process management
- [ ] 3.5 Create monitoring dashboard
- [ ] 3.6 Implement Executable Auditor enhancements

## Testing & Integration Phase
- [ ] 4.1 Test orchestration system components
- [ ] 4.2 Validate monitoring functionality
- [ ] 4.3 Test adaptive specialization
- [ ] 4.4 Integration testing

## Documentation Phase
- [ ] 5.1 Create implementation documentation
- [ ] 5.2 Document API interfaces
- [ ] 5.3 Create usage examples

## Output Requirements
- Save all files to code/orchestration/ directory
- Include comprehensive monitoring dashboard
- Provide clear implementation documentation
