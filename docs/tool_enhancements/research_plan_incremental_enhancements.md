# Incremental Agent Tool Enhancements Research Plan

## Objective
Design incremental agent tool enhancements that build upon existing systems, focusing on Executable Auditor enhancement, Survey Bot integration, B2B interfaces, and legacy integration strategies.

## Research Tasks

### Phase 1: Current System Analysis
- [x] 1.1 Analyze existing build_system.py architecture and capabilities
- [x] 1.2 Examine enhanced_build_system.py for current enhancements
- [x] 1.3 Review build_orchestrator.py for orchestration patterns
- [x] 1.4 Study monetization user stories for survey patterns
- [x] 1.5 Review architectural audit findings
- [x] 1.6 Analyze component compatibility requirements
- [x] 1.7 Examine Rasoom foundation design principles

### Phase 2: Enhancement Design
- [x] 2.1 Design Executable Auditor enhancement strategy
- [x] 2.2 Design Survey Bot integration approach
- [x] 2.3 Design B2B interface enhancements
- [x] 2.4 Design legacy integration patterns
- [x] 2.5 Design enhancement strategy (additive vs disruptive)

### Phase 3: Implementation Planning
- [x] 3.1 Define implementation paths for each enhancement
- [x] 3.2 Identify integration points
- [x] 3.3 Assess compatibility requirements
- [x] 3.4 Create rollout strategies

### Phase 4: Documentation
- [x] 4.1 Compile comprehensive enhancement designs
- [x] 4.2 Create actionable implementation plans
- [x] 4.3 Document compatibility assessments
- [x] 4.4 Finalize incremental_enhancements.md

## Key Focus Areas
1. **Executable Auditor Enhancement**: Analyze build capabilities that can be enhanced vs. rebuilt
2. **Survey Bot Integration**: Examine monetization patterns for workflow integration
