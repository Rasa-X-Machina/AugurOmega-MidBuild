# Triumvirate Ecosystem Integration Layer Research Plan

## Objective
Create a unified platform architecture integrating Agenta, Pranava, and Antakhara components with seamless communication, supporting existing components while enabling revolutionary new capabilities.

## Task Classification: Complex Architecture Design Task

## Key Insights from Architecture Analysis
- **Current State**: 3,000 microagents + 435 koshas with extensive scaffolding
- **Integration Gap**: Agenta (hierarchy), Pranava (orchestration), Antakhara (security) exist conceptually but lack implementation
- **Architecture Debt**: Missing process supervision, service discovery, observability, and policy enforcement
- **Scalability Challenge**: Need unified communication protocol supporting both legacy 38-agent and expanded microagent architecture
