## Task Classification
**Type**: Verification-Focused + Implementation Task
**Complexity**: High - Requires deep technical analysis and systematic implementation

## Task Overview
Develop a revolutionary performance optimization suite achieving 10× efficiency improvements for the Augur Omega ecosystem, implementing comprehensive monitoring, analysis, and automated optimization tools for 3,000 microagents and 435 koshas.

## Research Objectives
1. **Performance Baseline Analysis**: Establish current system performance metrics and identify bottlenecks

3. **Monitoring System Design**: Build real-time performance monitoring for distributed systems
4. **Automation Framework**: Implement self-optimizing workflows
5. **Implementation**: Create comprehensive optimization tools and documentation

## Current System Context (from input files)
- **Scale**: 3,000 microagents + 435 koshas (363 Domain + 72 Prime) + 12 business teams
